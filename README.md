# Employee Database: SQL Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of a fictional employee database, provided by Pewlett Hackard, containing data on employees from the 1980s and 1990s. The assignment is divided into three main parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

### Data Modeling

The first step involves creating an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the structure of the database. The ERD helps in understanding the relationships between different tables and the overall design of the database schema.

### Data Engineering

In this step, the ERD is translated into a set of SQL tables. Each CSV file provided is imported into its respective SQL table. This involves:
- Defining the schema for each table, including primary keys, foreign keys, and data types.
- Importing the data from CSV files into the SQL tables.

### Data Analysis

Finally, SQL queries are written to extract meaningful insights from the data. Some of the key analyses include:
- Listing the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
- Finding employees hired in a specific year.
- Identifying department managers and employees by department.
- Analyzing the distribution of last names among employees.
